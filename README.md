# Breast Cancer Classification

This project builds a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It demonstrates a complete ML pipeline including:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training using Random Forest
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Feature importance visualization

## Dataset

The dataset is available from `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook `breast_cancer_classifier.ipynb` to run the code and see results.
